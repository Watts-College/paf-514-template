# Practice Problems 

It is easy for non-obvious bugs to EASILY work their way into your code. Once you see the problem, it will seem obvious. But until you see it the code often looks fine and it’s unclear why it is not working as expected.

These practice problems are largely an opportunity to review content from Data Science I and develop a sensitivity to the nuances of R. It also demonstrates the importance of testing your code for unexpected behaviors and writing robust and maintainable scripts.

These questions are similar to riddles or brain teasers that help sharpen your critical thinking skills when working with code. Work through each on your own, then discuss solutions on YellowDig with classmates.

You can start working on the practice problems at any time. The dates listed here are rough guidelines for when you should start discussing a set of problems on Yellowdig with classmates. The Yellowdig discussion boards are not graded. 
  
Each question should have it's own pin. Please group responses to one question on one pin and avoid creating new pins when the question already exists.

# Quizzes 

The graded quizzes will be based on topics covered in the practice problems and on labs. They are designed to test your high-level conceptual understanding of the material. You will be asked questions about code, but you are not required to write code for the quizzes. For example, you might be given a code chunk and an error message that occurs and you would have to select the correct reason that the code is producing the error.

The quizzes are mostly multiple choice and are worth five points each. There will be six quizzes in total, worth up to 30 points, giving you some margin for error in earning your full 25 points for this component of the grade. 

There is no due date on quizzes - once they are published you can take them at any time before the end of class, but they are timed and you can only take them once.
